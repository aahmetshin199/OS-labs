1) In the first case we have "Hello" printed on a new line twice. This happens because first we print our Hello, withour
a new line, then the process is forked with "Hello" in the buffer, because there was no newline, then new line is appended
to the both processes, and printed for each so we get:
"Hello"
"Hello"

2) In the second case, we have "Hello\n" printed. After this, we fork a process with an empty buffer now (because there was a
newline). But since the buffer is empty, we just print a new line for each process. So we get
"Hello"
//empty line
//empty line
