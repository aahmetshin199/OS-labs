1) Decrease Hit/Miss ratio: If for each page we meet it for the first time so the was no reference of that page before,
then we increase the amount of misses because each such reference will be a miss, so
the hit ratio tends to 0 and miss ratio tends to N, so the more unique references the better

2) Increase Hit/Miss ratio: If we will query a page all the time (the same page), then the
number of hits is increased because this page is always in memory (and there will be just one miss
only when we referecne it the first time), so the more repeating references the better
